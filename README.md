# 🦀 DynaRust: Distributed Key-Value Store

DynaRust is a high-performance, distributed key–JSON‑value store built in Rust. It's designed for massive concurrency, reliable consistency, and seamless scalability 🔄.

It combines **lock-free concurrent storage**, **binary internal replication**, **causal consistency via Vector Clocks**, and a **SWIM-inspired gossip protocol** to deliver a fault‑tolerant, horizontally scalable datastore.

With its advanced real‑time update capabilities, DynaRust pushes live changes with latencies below 5 ms 🚀. Optimized for modern hardware, a single node can comfortably sustain peak traffic of up to **10,000+ live connections** 🔥—and you can increase capacity linearly by adding more nodes to your cluster.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **⚡️ MASSIVE CONCURRENCY (DashMap):**
    The storage engine uses granular, shard-based locking instead of global `RwLock`s. This allows simultaneous writes across different keys and tables without bottlenecking the entire system.

*   **🚀 BINARY REPLICATION (Bincode):**
    Node-to-node communication is now powered by Bincode. This binary format is significantly faster and more compact than JSON, reducing CPU usage and network saturation during high-load replication.

*   **🕙 CAUSAL CONSISTENCY (Vector Clocks):**
    Version tracking has graduated from simple integers to full **Vector Clocks**. DynaRust can now accurately track causality across distributed nodes, automatically resolving concurrent updates and ensuring data integrity.

*   **🎯 CONSISTENT HASHING:**
    Data is distributed using a consistent hashing ring with virtual nodes. This minimizes data movement when nodes join or leave, ensuring only a small fraction of keys are remapped.

*   **🛡️ RELIABILITY (Read Repair & Retries):**
    - **Read Repair:** Every `GET` request automatically checks all replicas. If a stale version is detected, a background task immediately "repairs" the outdated nodes with the latest value.
    - **Retries:** Outgoing replication now uses exponential backoff. Temporary network glitches no longer lead to data divergence.

*   **🛰️ SCALABLE MEMBERSHIP (SWIM Gossip):**
    The cluster uses a SWIM-inspired gossip protocol. Network overhead for health checks stays constant ($O(1)$ per node) regardless of cluster size. Indirect probing ensures highly accurate failure detection.

*   **🔥 REAL‑TIME UPDATES (SSE):**
    Instant updates using Server‑Sent Events (SSE). Subscribe to a key and receive changes in < 5 ms.
    ```bash
    curl -N http://localhost:8080/notifications/subscribe/statusKey
    ```

### 🔒 **Security**

- **Access Control:**
    - **Read:** Only the owner can read the record (passed via bearer header token)
    - **Write/Delete:** Only the record’s owner (as specified in the `owner` field) can modify or delete it.
    - **Enforcement:** All `PUT` and `DELETE` operations require an `Authorization` header. The server verifies that the requester matches the record’s owner.

- **Cluster Security:**
  - At compile time a SHA256 encryption key is embeded in the compiled binary (if that changes somehow in the future (recompile binary with different key) you won't be able to load the table, steps to properly compile are: run bash encryption.sh && cargo build --release and distribute only the binary under target/release/ to your nodes);
    - Each node should have a JWT_SECRET set, without this env var the node won't even start
        - Each node must present a **secret token** (set via the `CLUSTER_SECRET` environment variable) to join the cluster, ensuring only trusted nodes participate.

- **Transport Security (HTTPS):**
    - **Easy Certificate Generation:**
        - Run `bash cert.sh`, provide a password, and a `.p12` certificate will be generated under the `cert/` directory.
    - **HTTPS Mode:**
        - Set `DYNA_MODE=https` to enable HTTPS

---

**_Security is enforced at every layer: from user access to node-to-node communication, ensuring your data remains private and protected._**
*   **🌐 Distributed Storage:**
    Data is automatically partitioned and spread across all nodes in the cluster.

*   **🗄️ Automatic Snapshots:**
    Every 60 minutes DynaRust writes a JSON snapshot of the entire in‑memory store to `./snapshots/snapshot_<ts>.json`.
    By default only the last 100 snapshots are kept; older files are pruned automatically.
    You can override the retention limit with the `SNAP_LIMIT` environment variable (e.g. `SNAP_LIMIT=200`).

*   **✅ High Availability:**
    If one node fails, the remaining nodes continue to serve requests for the available data.

*   **🔄 Dynamic Cluster Membership:**
    Nodes can join or leave the cluster seamlessly without manual re‑configuration.

*   **🤝 Automatic State Sync:**
    New or returning nodes fetch the latest state from the cluster automatically.

*   **💾 Persistent Storage:**
    Data is saved to a local `storage.db` file to prevent data loss upon node restarts.

*   **🔌 RESTful API:**
    A simple HTTP interface (using `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) makes it easy to interact with your data.

#### Quick `curl` Examples

```bash
# 1) Register Alice
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:6660/auth/alice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"s3cr3t"}'

# 2) Log in (get token)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:6660/auth/alice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"s3cr3t"}' | jq -r .token)

# 3) PUT (must include token)
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:6660/default/key/foo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"value": {"name": "bar"}}'

# 4) PATCH (partially update)
curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:6660/default/key/foo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## 🧠 How it Works (Conceptual Overview)

DynaRust uses eventual consistency via state synchronization:

1.  **👤 Client Request:** A client sends an HTTP request (e.g., `PUT /default/key/mykey`) to any node.
2.  **🖥️ Local Processing:** The receiving node updates/reads its **in‑memory** store 💭 immediately.
3.  **💾 Persistence:** The node periodically saves its memory state to `storage.db` for durability.
4.  **🔄 Cluster Synchronization (Gossip):**
    *   Nodes exchange membership info & state updates periodically.
    *   This ensures all nodes eventually converge to the same state (Eventual Consistency).
    *   *Real‑time Updates:* Subscribed clients receive changes via SSE instantly (< 5ms) ⚡️.
    *   **🚀 Performance Highlight:** A typical VPS node (1GB RAM, 100Mbps) handles up to **5000 concurrent live SSE connections**. Add more nodes to scale capacity!
5.  **🤝 Joining:** A new node contacts an existing node (`JOIN_ADDRESS`), fetches the cluster state, and joins.

## 🐳 Deployment with Docker

Docker simplifies deployment and dependency management.

### 🔧 Prerequisites

*   **Docker:** Version 20.10 or newer installed and running.
*   **🌐 Network Connectivity:** Ensure containers on the same Docker network can reach each other on the `LISTEN_ADDRESS` port (e.g., `6660`).

### ▶️ Steps

1.  **🧱 Build the Image (if not done):**
    ```bash
    docker build -t dynarust:latest .
    ```

2.  **🏃 Run the Container(s):**

    *   **Running the First Node:**
        ```bash
        # Create a network first (recommended)
        docker network create dynanet

        # Start the first node, detached (-d), named, on the network, mapping host port 6660
        docker run -d --name dynarust-node1 --network dynanet -p 6660:6660 \
          dynarust:latest 0.0.0.0:6660
        ```
        *Listens on port 6660 inside the container.*

    *   **Running Additional Nodes:**
        Use the container name (`dynarust-node1`) and internal port (`6660`) as the `JOIN_ADDRESS`.
        ```bash
        # Start a second node, map host port 6661, join node1
        docker run -d --name dynarust-node2 --network dynanet -p 6661:6660 \
          dynarust:latest 0.0.0.0:6660 dynarust-node1:6660
        ```

    *   **💾 Data Persistence (Important!):**
        Mount a volume to persist the `storage.db` file outside the container.
        ```bash
        # Create a named volume (e.g., dynarust-data1)
        docker volume create dynarust-data1

        # Run node1 with the volume mounted to /app (where storage.db is saved)
        docker run -d --name dynarust-node1 --network dynanet -p 6660:6660 \
          -v dynarust-data1:/app \
          dynarust:latest 0.0.0.0:6660

        # Run subsequent nodes with their own volumes
        docker volume create dynarust-data2
        docker run -d --name dynarust-node2 --network dynanet -p 6661:6660 \
          -v dynarust-data2:/app \
          dynarust:latest 0.0.0.0:6660 dynarust-node1:6660
        ```
        *(Adjust the mount source/target `/app` if your Dockerfile places `storage.db` elsewhere).*

---
### 📦 Installation

You can either build DynaRust directly from source or use a pre‑built Docker image.

#### Option 1: Build from Source

1.  **📂 Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourfavDev/DynaRust # Replace with actual URL if needed
    cd DynaRust
    ```

2.  **🧱 Build the Project:**
    Compile the Rust code for an optimized release build:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    The final binary is located at `target/release/DynaRust`.

#### Option 2: Using Docker 🐳

If you prefer containerization and have Docker installed:

1.  **🧱 Build the Docker Image:**
    From the repository’s root directory:
    ```bash
    docker build -t dynarust:latest .
    ```
    This command builds a container image named `dynarust` with the tag `latest`.
---

## ▶️ Running DynaRust

After building (or using Docker), start DynaRust nodes using command‑line arguments to set the listening address and (optionally) join an existing cluster.

**Command Syntax:**

```bash
./target/release/DynaRust <LISTEN_ADDRESS> [JOIN_ADDRESS]
```

*   **`LISTEN_ADDRESS` (Required):** 📡 The IP address and port for this node to listen on (e.g., `127.0.0.1:6660` for local, `0.0.0.0:6660` for all interfaces).
*   **`JOIN_ADDRESS` (Optional):** 🔗 The IP address and port of an existing DynaRust node to join. Omit this to start a new cluster.

**Example 1: Start the First Node 🟢**

Starts a single node locally on port 6660, forming a new cluster:
```bash
./target/release/DynaRust 127.0.0.1:6660
```
*Check the terminal for output logs 📝.*

**Example 2: Start a Second Node and Join the First 🔗**

Starts a second node on port 6661 and joins the cluster via the first node (`127.0.0.1:6660`):
```bash
./target/release/DynaRust 127.0.0.1:6661 127.0.0.1:6660
```
*The new node synchronizes its state with the cluster 🤝.*

Add more nodes by providing unique `LISTEN_ADDRESS` values and specifying any existing node as the `JOIN_ADDRESS`.

## 📡 Using the API

Interact with your DynaRust cluster using standard HTTP requests. Send requests to *any* node; the system handles routing and consistency internally.

**❗️ Important Notes:**

*   Replace `localhost:6660` in examples with the actual `LISTEN_ADDRESS` of a running node.
*   Replace `{table}` with your desired table name (e.g., `default`, `users`, `products`). If omitted, the `"default"` table is used implicitly in older versions, but explicit use is recommended.
*   For `PUT` requests, the body **must** be JSON (e.g., `{"value": "your-data"}`) and the `Content-Type: application/json` header must be set.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Check these common points:

1.  **❌ Node Fails to Join Cluster:**
    *   **Target Node Running?** Is the node at `JOIN_ADDRESS` active?
    *   **Network:** Can the joining node reach the `JOIN_ADDRESS` (IP & port)?
        *   *Native:* Use `ping <ip>` and `nc -zv <ip> <port>`.
        *   *Docker:* Are containers on the same `docker network`? Use container names (e.g., `dynarust-node1:6660`). Check `docker logs <container_name>`.
    *   **Address/Port Match?** Double-check `LISTEN_ADDRESS` and `JOIN_ADDRESS`.
    *   **Logs:** Check logs on *both* nodes (see Debugging below).

2.  **❓ Data Not Synchronizing / Inconsistent Reads:**
    *   **Patience:** Eventual consistency takes time (usually milliseconds to seconds). Allow a brief moment for gossip.
    *   **Membership:** Check cluster view: `curl http://<any-node-address>/membership`. Are all nodes listed?
    *   **Logs:** Look for network errors or sync issues.

3.  **❓💾 Data Lost After Restart:**
    *   **Permissions:** Does the process have write access to the directory containing `storage.db`? Enough disk space?
    *   **Docker Persistence:** Did you mount a volume correctly (see [Deployment with Docker](#-deployment-with-docker))? Without a volume, data is lost when the container stops.

4.  **🐞 General Debugging:**
    Enable detailed logs using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:
    *   **Native Execution:**
        ```bash
        RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/DynaRust <LISTEN_ADDRESS> [JOIN_ADDRESS]
        ```
    *   **Docker Execution:** Add `-e RUST_LOG=debug` to your `docker run` command.
        ```bash
        docker run -d --name dynarust-node1 --network dynanet -p 6660:6660 \
          -v dynarust-data1:/app \
          -e RUST_LOG=debug \
          dynarust:latest 0.0.0.0:6660
        ```
       Then check logs: `docker logs dynarust-node1`
